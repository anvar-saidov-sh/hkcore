It is commonly employed in survival analysis to analyze time-to-event data, where censoring occurs when the event of interest is not observed for some subjects due to incomplete follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier estimator accounts for censoring by adjusting the denominator as follow-up time increases, providing unbiased estimates of survival probabilities over time. This estimator is widely used in medical research, clinical trials, and epidemiology to analyze survival outcomes and compare survival curves between different groups or treatments."
